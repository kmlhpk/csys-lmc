2018/19 Computer Systems - LMC Summative Assignment

The assignment was to make a program in the Little Minion Computer (a variant of the Little Man Computer maintained by Prof Magnus Bordewich, who taught half of this module) that would convert a number from one base to another. It was an excellent first coursework, forcing one to think about whether they will optimise for space or for time (often "both" is a difficult goal to achieve). I went for the former - a small solution that took comically long to execute - and got a pretty nice mark. 

This was the first coursework piece of uni, and I completed it before I knew how to use git. As such, the "version control" I used is akin to the old joke of increasingly-aggressive "FINAL-FINAL-IREALLYMEANITTHISTIME" messsages appended onto filenames. Only the final result is present here, almost two years after completion and submission. This is mostly to spare me some embarrassment.
